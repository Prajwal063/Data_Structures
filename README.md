# Data Structures Implementation

This repository contains a collection of various data structures implemented in Python. Data structures are essential for organizing and managing data efficiently in computer science and software development. This project serves as a resource for understanding and practicing different data structures.


## Introduction

Data structures are fundamental building blocks in computer science and are used to store, organize, and manipulate data. This repository aims to provide implementations of various data structures in Python, with a focus on clarity and educational value.


## Implemented Data Structures

Currently, the following data structures have been implemented:

1. **Arrays**: Basic array implementation with dynamic resizing.
2. **Linked Lists**: Singly and doubly linked lists.
3. **Stacks**: A stack data structure with push, pop, and peek operations.
4. **Queues**: A queue data structure with enqueue and dequeue operations.
5. **Trees**: Binary Search Trees (BST) and AVL Trees.
6. **Heaps**: Binary Min-Heap and Max-Heap.
7. **Graphs**: Graph representation and common graph algorithms (BFS, DFS).
8. **Hash Tables**: Hash table with separate chaining collision resolution.
9. **Trie**: Trie data structure for efficient string storage and retrieval.

Each data structure is organized into its own directory within the repository, containing both the implementation and relevant documentation.


Feel free to explore and experiment with the various data structures available in this repository. Each data structure directory contains example code and explanations.


## Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome! If you'd like to contribute a new data structure, fix a bug, or enhance the documentation, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.

2. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix:

   ```shell
   git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
   ```

3. Make your changes and commit them:

   ```shell
   git commit -m 'Add a new data structure'
   ```

4. Push your changes to your fork:

   ```shell
   git push origin feature/my-new-feature
   ```

5. Open a pull request on the original repository, describing your changes in detail.
